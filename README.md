## This is a SIMP module

This module is a component of the [System Integrity Management Platform](https://simp-project.com),
a compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, they can be submitted to our [JIRA](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/).

Please read our [Contribution Guide](https://simp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributors_guide/index.html).

## Upgrading From 7.3.0 Or Earlier

Legacy auth.conf, `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/auth.conf`, has been deprecated.
`pupmod-simp-pupmod` will back up legacy puppet auth.conf after upgrade.

The puppetserver's auth.conf is now managed by Puppet. You will need to
re-produce any custom work done to legacy auth.conf in the new auth.conf, via
the `puppet_authorization::rule` define.  The stock rules are managed in
`pupmod::master::simp_auth`.
