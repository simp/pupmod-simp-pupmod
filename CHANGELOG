  randomize your nodes. Any string will work.

- Add appropriate confines to the passenger* facts and no longer hard
  code paths.
- Ensure that the puppetmaster init does not fire off alongside httpd.

  manipulation of configuration file entries.

  conflict on upgrade.

  or calculated at all times. This should make response time better overall.
- Removed the passenger_root fact since the EPEL version of passenger doesn't
  supply the utils.
- This is another mid-level jump due to the fact that EPEL split out
  the native Passenger libraries! These are included in the associated
  patch set but there's no good way to tie them together explicitly so
  be careful!

  and leaves a lock file behind. The default is set to 4 times the croninterval
  and will not exceed 4 hours.

- Added the variables:
