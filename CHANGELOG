  changes in the HTTP responses from the Puppet Server.

  randomize your nodes. Any string will work.

* Mon Sep 08 2014 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 6.0.0-11
- Add appropriate confines to the passenger* facts and no longer hard
  code paths.
- Ensure that the puppetmaster init does not fire off alongside httpd.

  manipulation of configuration file entries.

  conflict on upgrade.

- Require puppet 3.X and puppet-server 3.X because of an upgrade to use

  or calculated at all times. This should make response time better overall.
- Removed the passenger_root fact since the EPEL version of passenger doesn't
  supply the utils.
- This is another mid-level jump due to the fact that EPEL split out
  the native Passenger libraries! These are included in the associated
  patch set but there's no good way to tie them together explicitly so
  be careful!

- Ensure that autosign.conf is 644.

  and leaves a lock file behind. The default is set to 4 times the croninterval
  and will not exceed 4 hours.

  has changed.

* Tue Feb 23 2010 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 0.1-36
- Removed the 'nice' ability added in 0.1-33 as it propogates the nice value to
  all spawned services.

- Refactored the code to be more maintainable.
- Added the variables:
