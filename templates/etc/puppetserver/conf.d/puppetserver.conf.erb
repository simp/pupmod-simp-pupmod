    # PLEASE NOTE: Use caution when modifying the below settings. Modifying
    # these settings will change the value of the corresponding Puppet settings
    # for Puppet Server, but not for the Puppet CLI tools. This likely will not
    # be a problem with master-var-dir, master-run-dir, or master-log-dir unless
    # some critical setting in puppet.conf is interpolating the value of one
    # of the corresponding settings, but it is important that any changes made to
    # master-conf-dir and master-code-dir are also made to the corresponding Puppet
    # settings when running the Puppet CLI tools. See
    # https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppetserver/latest/puppet_conf_setting_diffs.html#overriding-puppet-settings-in-puppet-server
